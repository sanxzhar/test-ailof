RVZicond Integer Conditional operations
-------------------------------------------

The instructions follow the format for R-type instructions with 3 operands (i.e., 2 source operands and 1 destination operand). Using these instructions, branchless sequences can be implemented (typically in two-instruction sequences) without the need for instruction fusion, special provisions during the decoding of architectural instructions, or other microarchitectural provisions.

- **CZERO.EQZ**: Conditional zero, if condition is equal to zero

    **Format**: czero.eqz rd, rs1, rs2

    **Description**: This instruction behaves as if there is a conditional branch dependent on rs2 being equal to zero, wherein it branches to code that writes a 0 into rd when the equivalence is true, and otherwise falls through to code that moves rs1 into rd.

    **Pseudocode**: if (x[rs2] == 0) x[rd] = 0 else x[rs1]

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: NONE

- **CZERO.NEZ**: Conditional zero, if condition is nonzero

    **Format**: czero.nez rd, rs1, rs2

    **Description**: This instruction behaves as if there is a conditional branch dependent on rs2 being not equal to zero, wherein it branches to code that writes a 0 into rd when the equivalence is true, and otherwise falls through to code that moves rs1 into rd

    **Pseudocode**: if (x[rs2] != 0) x[rd] = 0 else x[rs1]

    **Invalid values**: NONE

    **Exception raised**: NONE
