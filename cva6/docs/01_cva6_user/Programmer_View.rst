Programmer’s View
=================
RISC-V specifications allow many variations. This chapter provides more details about RISC-V variants available for the programmer.
A global view of the CVA6 family is provided, as well as details for each verified configuration.

RISC-V Extensions
-----------------

CVA6 family
~~~~~~~~~~~

The following extensions are available for the CVA6 family.
Some of them are optional and are enabled through parameters in the SystemVerilog design.

**RV32** denotes RISC-V 32-bit extensions. **RV64** denotes RISC-V 64-bit extensions.

Notes:

* Note 1: These extensions have a slightly  different definition between RV32 and RV64. They are therefore denoted with digits (e.g. RV\ **32**\ M).
* Note 2: These extensions do not differ between RV32 and RV64. They are therefore denoted without digits below (e.g. RVZifencei).

*The following tables detail the availability of extensions for the various CVA6 configurations:*

RISC-V Virtual Memory
---------------------

CVA6 family
~~~~~~~~~~~

CV32A6 supports the RISC-V **Sv32** virtual memory when the ``MMUEn`` parameter is set to 1 (and ``Xlen`` is set to 32).

CV64A6 supports the RISC-V **Sv39** virtual memory when the ``MMUEn`` parameter is set to 1 (and ``Xlen`` is set to 64).

Within CV64A6, the hypervisor extension is available and supports **Sv39x4** virtual memory when the ``CVA6ConfigHExtEn`` parameter is set to 1 (and ``Xlen`` is set to 64).


By default, CV32A6 and CV64A6 are in RISC-V **Bare** mode. **Sv32** or **Sv39** are enabled by writing the required configuration to ``satp`` register mode bits.

In CV32A6 the mode bit of ``satp`` register is bit 31.  **Sv32** is enabled by writing 1 to ``satp[31]``.

In CV64A6 the mode bits of ``satp`` register are bits [63:60]. **Sv39** is enabled by writing 8 to ``satp[63:60]``.

When the ``MMUEn`` parameter is set to 0, CV32A6 and CV64A6 are always in RISC-V **Bare** mode; ``satp`` mode bit(s) remain at 0 and writes to this register are ignored.


By default, the hypervisor extension is disabled. It can be enabled by setting bit 7 in the ``misa`` CSR, which corresponds to the letter H.

When ``CVA6ConfigHExtEn`` parameter is set to 0, the hypervisor extension is always disabled; bit 7 in the ``misa`` CSR remains at 0 and writes to this register are ignored.

Even if the hypervisor extension is enabled, by default, address translation for Supervisor, Hypervisor and Virtual Supervisor are disabled. They can be enabled by writing the required configuration to ``satp``, ``hgatp`` and ``vsatp`` registers respectively.

**Sv39** is enabled for Supervisor or Virtual Supervisor by writing 8 to ``satp[63:60]`` or ``vsatp[63:60]`` respectively.

**Sv39x4** is enabled for Hypervisor by writing 8 to ``hgatp[63:60]``.


Notes for the integrator:

* The virtual memory is implemented by a memory management unit (MMU) that accelerates the translation from virtual memory addresses (as handled by the core) to physical memory addresses. The MMU integrates translation lookaside buffers (TLB) and a hardware page table walker (PTW). The number of instruction and data TLB entries are configured with ``InstrTlbEntries`` and ``DataTlbEntries``.

* The MMU offers a microarchitectural optimization featuring two levels of TLB: level 1 TLB (sized by ``InstrTlbEntries`` and ``DataTlbEntries``) and a shared level 2 TLB. The shared level 2 TLB is enabled when the ``UseSharedTlb`` parameter is set to 1. The size of the shared TLB can be selected with the parameter ``SharedTlbDepth``. The optimization has no consequences on the programmer's view. 

CV32A60AX virtual memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CV32A60AX integrates an MMU and supports both the **Bare** and **Sv32** addressing modes.


CV32A60X virtual memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CV32A60X integrates no MMU and only supports the **Bare** addressing mode.

CV64A6_MMU virtual memory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CV64A6_MMU integrates an MMU and supports both the **Bare** and **Sv39** addressing modes.

Memory Alignment
----------------
CVA6 **does not support non-aligned** memory accesses.

*This is applicable to all configurations.*

Harts
-----
CVA6 features a **single hart**, i.e. a single hardware thread.

Therefore the words *hart* and *core* have the same meaning in this guide.

*This is applicable to all configurations.*
